A design website for the peace prints company

## Available scripts

The following are the scripts I used to compile this project

### `npn run start`

This script starts the application in the development stage.
It compiles the SCSS code into CSS code which runs parallel with the liveserver script

### `npm run build`

The script compresses the final CSS code into a minified code
